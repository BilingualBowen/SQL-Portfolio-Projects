The original dataset file "owid-covid-data (1).csv" is downloaded from the website:
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 

The data records are from 2020-01-01 to 2024-01-08.

Certain columns are deleted and rearranged and saved in two different files:
"CovidDeaths.xlsx" and "CovidVaccinations.xlsx".

The excel files above are loaded into the Microsoft SQL Server.

And the queries showcases are saved in the file:
"COVID SQL Server Portfolio.sql"

Only the SQL file is uploaded into the Github, as other files are too large.
